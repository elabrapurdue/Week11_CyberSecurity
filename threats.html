                Cyber threats are malicious activities aimed at disrupting, damaging, or unauthorizedly accessing digital 
                information, systems, and networks. These threats can come from a variety of sources, including cybercriminals, hacktivists, 
                state-sponsored groups, and even insiders. Common types of cyber threats include malware, ransomware, phishing, and Distributed 
                Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Malware, for example, can infiltrate systems to steal data or control operations, while ransomware 
                locks users out of their own systems until a ransom is paid. Phishing scams, which trick users into revealing sensitive information, 
                are increasingly sophisticated and can lead to identity theft or financial loss. DDoS attacks, on the other hand, overwhelm a network 
                with traffic, making services inaccessible to users. As our dependence on digital infrastructure grows, so does the frequency and impact of 
                these cyber threats, making cybersecurity a crucial field focused on developing strategies, technologies, and practices to safeguard sensitive data 
                and ensure system integrity.
